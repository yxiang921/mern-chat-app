# Real Time Chat App

Designed and developed a real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the core architecture. Employed additional technologies such as DaisyUI for Tailwind CSS, Socket.io for real-time communication, JWT for secure authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.

## ðŸ›  Skills
- Frontend: ReactJS, DaisyUI (TailwindCSS)
- Backend: ExpressJS
- Database: MongoDB (using mongoose in ExpressJS)
- Others: JWT, SocketIO, Zustand, Brcypt, React Router




## Features

- User authentication & authorization with JWT
- Real time communication with SocketIO
- Online user status
- Error handling for both frontend and backend
- Search user for chat




## Lessons Learned

As the project evolves, maintaining clean and scalable code becomes crucial for future development and collaboration. My solution is to adhere to coding best practices, employ modular and well-documented code, and follow a consistent coding style.

Secondly, implementing real-time communication using Socket.IO is also one of the challenging parts. I learned a lot about Socket.IO, including event emission, while building this project.
